# ContestHub

## Overview

ContestHub fetches upcoming and ongoing programming contests from multiple platforms including CodeChef, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, and LeetCode. It consolidates this information into a structured format and saves it as JSON files for easy access and further use. The project uses a backend repository for data storage and employs DevOps CI for automation.

## Features
